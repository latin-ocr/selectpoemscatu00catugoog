Ρ.49ζ This poem, generallycalled ‘Coma Berenices,'isaversion
oi the lost'Bcpcvtrns πλόκαμοι oi Callimachus, and may have

Underneath a new-old sign
Sip in beverage divine,
Ani fedgin with contented smack

knowing about all the luminaries oi the firmament, the risings
and obscuratione ci the stars, ecli ses of the sun, and (mark
the anti-climax) the love-affairs olpthe moon. The king ees
out to mighty wara, a scarred veteran-oi last night’s love
encounter. Note next the sceptioism as to the genuineness of
abride's tears, and the playful budinope about the cause oi
