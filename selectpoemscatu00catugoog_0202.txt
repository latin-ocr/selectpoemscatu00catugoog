s riorus axvi, 54-73. 149

Another interpretation, which seems due to ‘too much
learning‚' is given by Orelli. Arsinoe, wile oi Ptolemy
Philadelphus, rs represented us riding on an ostrich, in c
statue at Helicon. Probably there was a similar statue iu
the temple of Arsinoe-Venus, on the Libyan promontory of
Zephyrium. Thon Uuiyona Memnonio = the brrd risen from
the ashes ol Memnon, aud will be the ostrith. Ellis suggests

another bird, a kind of hswk.

54. Arsinoe, wife ol Ptolem 11„ was deificd es Arsinoe-
Aphroditc. A temple was bu' t to her on one of the promon-
tories called Zephyrium: hence she is called Zephyritis, v. 57.
There was a Zephyrium in the district of cyrenae, anciently
ancrian settlement; hence perhaps the epithet locridas

(thauros, MSS.).
P. 51. 58. (trata. The Ptolemies were ol Macedonian descent.

incola lltoribua For construction cf. ux1v.301, muricem
mom'bue Idri. Arsinoe must huvehadutemple near Canopus.

59. mr tn uon tbi, MSS. The simplest emendation is
‘Diva titi: ha, tu, Boeoto, who is spoken of simply as douc
once or twice in Virgil (cf. ‘membra deo victua ‘Munera
laetitiamque det’ Aen. n 636); und the context here would
prevent any ambiguity. [Looking at Hit dii as one syllable
reduplicated—ra very common occurrence in all Mus-this
reading involves only the change of a to t]

Ellis reads ‘Hic juveat Icmario’ = Bacclto, but this loses us
the undoubtedly round and picturasque uario.

63. uvidulam a fluctu Why the Lock had to be ‘dipped in
the wave’ is not clear, unless it was es part of the ceremony
of its transformation. Orelli reads afflata, Baehrens o luctu.

In uttdalmn remark the change of gender (cl. 37, 39), as
also in tcum nte, 91 ; compare mv. 17.
