oncof rivahy for the first place. That Horace was
strongly adverse 10 the Alexandrine school, of which
no imitativa traco is found in him, cannot be doubted.
But (Epist. 1. i.) it is equally certain that hc was at
least as strongly adverse to the earlier and untutored
Latin poetry. In his literary criticisms and in his
odes he omitted to mention Catullus with honour· as
a lyrio poet, partly because Catullus wasa Republicau‚
partly because the elder poet wrote mostly in matres
unused by the Augustam chiefly because Horaoe¹
devoted himself specially to imitation of the older
s Greek lyrics. Catullus, however, was of infinitely
higher lyrical genius than Horace, and this is shown
‘ in the conscious imitations by the latter exhibited
in the following table.

was more Alexandrino in his artificia-l, nnreal and elaborate
lyrico than Catullus the student oi Alexandria. Sec Munro
