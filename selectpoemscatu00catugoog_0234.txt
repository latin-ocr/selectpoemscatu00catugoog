of Catullus 642 elegiacsremein (sxa-om). Ovid’s rules,
such as the close of a thought with a couplet, the avoidance
ol elision‚ especially in the latter half of both the hexameter
and the pentameter, the pre nderance ol dactyle, the ending
of the couplet with adissy able, which must be either noun
or verb, and the like, were not observed by Catullus. In the
hexameter he has 9 monosyllaba endings, 9 tetrasyllaba, 9
disponduic, 2 pentasyllaba (LXVIII. 105,xov11. 5). One hexa-
meter (cxlv. 3) consiste of six spondees. In the pentameter
there is one monosyllabae ending (LXVI. 8). 83 trisyllabic end-
ings, 98 tetrasyllaba, 17 pentasyllaba, lheptasyllcbic (axum.
72„ and 34 adjectivcl endings. Elision occurs between the
first and second halves ol the pentameter 16 times; hiatus
thrice.
