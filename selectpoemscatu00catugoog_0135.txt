A genitive of quality may be used when the substantive
expressing the quality ie accompanied by an adjective. Thus q
we can say munus maximi rivae (xvn. 7), centum puer artium ¹
(Hor. Od. 1v. i. 15) litua amoeni veceeaaw (Juv. 111. 4). But we
may not say manue visua puer ortium, litua veeeauta. It seems,
however, thet ii a substantive be attended by an adjective (aa
patr by divertas here) a simqlhe genitive ol quality is allowable,
though very uneommon. us in Verg. Eel. tv. 24, we have
‘fallax herba veneat! The whole hrase may then be said to ¹
