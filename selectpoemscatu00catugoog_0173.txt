For a complete account oi the worship of Cybele see Ellis’
introduction to this poem, a fine example oi hin vast erudition.
For the Galliumbic metre aee Appendrx I. F.

The worship oi the ‘Great Mother¹ (whom Lucretius iden·
tifies with lellus, giving an explanation oi the allegorical
elementa ci her processior, 11. 600), was introduced iutc Rome
irem Phrygia, m obedience to a co'mmand oi the Sibylline
books, 203 n. 0. Her image, a small black stoue, was brought
from Pessinos, a town on the slope of Dindymus3 in her
hznzfflrfllpdemple was built, and the games called Mepolecia
esa ,

There is nothing, however, that ie specially Roman in the
treatment oi her codun in the present poem. Every allusion
is essentinlly Greek ; and all internal evidence would allow, ii
indeed it dces not sug est, that we have here a translation oi
a lost (lreek model. ⁴ he ἅπαξ deperisse, ¹such as hederiperoc

intended tc be presented. Roman literature cn the subject
cf the mayoc muter, it is alec to be remarked, contains no
allusion tc Attis, down to the date of the present poem 3 of
which we may at least affirm, that in versificaticn, phraseclcgy,
and conception, itis essentially Greek.

The distinctive features of the worship oi Cybele were an
enthusiestio excitement‚ amounting to madnese (μαίνεσθαι τῇ
θεώ), tasting, and seli-eustratium Attis, here a Greek youth,
not a god, ie re reaeuted as leaving his home under an irresis-
tible impulse w 'ch had seized himas a devoteeo the Idaean
Mother; as crossing the Aegean ς as landin near the Phrygian
Ida; aud cs penetrating the foresta, that ciothe the mountain

tc its summit, the sacred abode os the goddess, whence heis
suffered tc return no more
