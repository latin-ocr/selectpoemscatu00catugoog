law which requires the coincidence of verbal acceut and
metrical ictus at the close ol the verse. One (nutv. 55) tao
dlaeyllablea (not dispondaie) break the same lawr in the
Georgica tbnce, 11 east, and a dozen t1meu 1n the last books
ef the Aeneid. A tetrasyllable (not dispondaie) occurs twice
in nm (bannimus), the same word being found in 1 similar
position in nxiv. twice, aud ealatbiacr' once. Virgil has ly·

lreely ends with slmrlar tetrasyllablcs when they are proper
names. Once iu 1111, twice in 11111, the last word is penta-
syllabic. Such endings (as 1111 tetrasyllabie endings not re·
