may Ι heg the loan of your hearers for a little while? forI
want to go in etate to the feast of Serapia.” “Truce·l” oriedI
to the lady, “when I spolie just now of chattele of mine I was
not thinking. My dear friend, Gaius Cinna, ia the nominal
purchaeer: but whether things are his or mine ia all one to
me; for I use them as freely aa if Ι bought for myeelf. Yon,
however, are a mischievone dunce and a plagne,·f0r you do ¹
not forgive a alip of the tongne.'' ’

Catullns’ firm and close attachment to his friends is
one of the leading traits of his character. The feeling
of friendship was elevated by him into devotion,
demanding a complete and fervent faith on both
parts, and imposing in action a circle of attentioris aa
obligatory aa religione exercises, Breaoh of duty waa
not a sentimental injnry, bnt sacrilege3 an nnfaithful
friend wae not fickle, butan apostate. Such an apos-
tate the Varus¹ of the preceding poem proved to be.
Catullus shows in the following linea how deeply he
felt the blow :-

‘Unfaithfnl Alfenus, betrayer of companiona eo linked to·
gether, hae your hard heart no compassion left for your once·
cheriahed friend? Do yon not tremble to caat me off, and
break your vowa, like a traitorf Treachery ia irreligion, and
finds no favour with the goda. Despiaing thia truth, you
abendon me to my fate in a sea of troubles. What now munt

not youraelf bid magive myheart to yon, ingrate, inveigling
me into Iove'a periloua land by promises of perfect seeuneyr
