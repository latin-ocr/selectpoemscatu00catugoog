inno other example. Even if it were possible, Mauro, who,

the common end conventionol form. But if we hed (or oonld
understand) the oi, the thought would be rather different, and
would be, ‘I use hin roperty ue freely us whatever Ι moy

tense. And this suggests the reading quoe for quarn [es in

MSS.]; in which cose tho sense would be, ⁴1 use no more
