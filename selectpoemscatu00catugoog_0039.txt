‘lepidum novum libellum!

Esnnrnr Roman poetry‚ ss we have seen, failed sor

themost partiorlaolr offorrn. Itwesalsoeonfined 'l
in subject, end attempted only the epos, the drama,

¹ satire, and (in a limited sense) the epigram In the
ege of Catullus, better directed study resulted in a
trner and larger sense of the various forms of literery
eompositiom and the lydo, the idyll, end the e‘ltsgy
were added to Roman literature. This new birth of
Latin poetry is represented to us by Catullus alone.
The works of all the other writers of his time have
been lost ; and thesaure irony of fate, which gare us
Hesiod in plaoe of Archilochus end the Greek lyriets,
has preserved Oieero’s translation of Aratus, instead
of the works oi Bibaculus end Calvus. Catullus was,
however, as fer as we ean learn, far greater than the
rest oi his eontemporaries; and should be regarded,
therefore, as the first in time, as well as in genius, of
Roman lyrie, elegiae, idyssio, and epigrammatio poete.
