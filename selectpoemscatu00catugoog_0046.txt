Gamo Varamos Garunnae was born at Verona (87
οι· 84 lau), of a good family. We hear of his father
as the friend and frequently the host oi Julius Caesar.
The poet eame to Rome aa soon ae he became hia own

master, and there made his settled home. There he ,

had the society of Calvus, Cinna, Cornificius, young
Asinius Pollio, Alfenus Varus, (laelius Rufus, and,
perhaps, Oieer0; and there he fell into the toils of
Clodia, the wife of the eonsul Metellus Celer, and the
Lesbia of the poems. We hear oi visits to his villa at
Tibur, to another villa at Sirmio, and also to Verona.
The pleaeures of the town seem to have kept him
always poor 3 and he followed the praetor Memmius to
Bithynia, which had newly beeome a Roman province,
in the vain hope of mending his fortunae (57 aa). On
his homeward journey he went to 'see hie brothers ’
grave in the Troad, passed through the famous eitiee
of Asia, and returned in his yaeht to Sirmio (56 aa).
This retreat he left for Rome, where he seems to have
spent the remainder of his short life. We know that
he died young, perhaps (as is said) at the age of thirty 3
and, as his poema eontain no certain allusion to events
of later date than 54 ne, we may believe that to have
been the year of his death
