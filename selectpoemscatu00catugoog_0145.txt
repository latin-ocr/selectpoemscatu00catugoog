Ι l. Sirmio (Sermione) is a peninsula connected with the
southern ebore ol the Lago di Gardt by a narrow strip of lond,
which st times is covere by water.

paene insulsum This adjective] use of the adverb with
a substantive, so common in Greek, when receded by en
article, is very rere in Latin, owing robably to the Latin
want ol the article. We have, indes , a use, similar to the
Greek, when the adverb is preceded by a demonstrative, in
‘iste post plzaselue,' 1v. 10, or by an adjective quelilying the
seme substantive, ‘omnes circo popvli,' Livy xx1v. iii„ ‘duobus
circa portie,' Id xxm. xvi, or a possessive enitive dependent
on the seme substantive ‘ers' semper lenitae,' l'er. Andr. 175 (Pl.
Pers. 385, quoted by Wagner, is not necessarily parallel).
But the only other exact parallel to paeneinsula is quoted by
Munro from Caesar B. G. vn xxxvi. 2, ‘paene obsessionent’
