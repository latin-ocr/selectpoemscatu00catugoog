poems of Catullus, in which he has immortalized, by
truthfully reoording, his sineere affectione, passionete
love, genuine hatreds, olear wit, and hearty meriu'ment

only one plaee on earth where eetive existence was
possible to a men3 that it was better to struggle and
stsrve at Rome than batten ou the pastures of all the
