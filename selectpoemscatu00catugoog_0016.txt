waste of ocean, and muted the shsdes of night before the
rattling hoofs of his new-risen steens—thet moment Slesp
hastily took ffight from the waking Asta, end rested not till
he found a hasen in Queen Pasithsa's bosom!

Waking brings repentance3 but repentsnee is re-
bellion against the goddess, who appears in her eheriot,
drawn by lions, to execute vengesnee. The poem
thus closes 2-.

into the festnesses of the forest, and there remained in bondege
tor ever, until he died.
