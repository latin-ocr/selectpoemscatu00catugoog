εἰνηα verbo of Catullus are in some cases very different
from the mutilated presentations of the extant codices.
But it would be inadvisable to admit into a text even
attractive readings which differ widely from those of
our best, if still inadequato‚ authorities. The following
text will be found to adhere (except in undoubted cor-
rections) to the best MSS.; which have been made
accessibls by recent and most valuahle appwratws
critici, especially that of Ennia

In spelling, all peculiarities have been avoided
These occur largely in the extant MSS„ and some of
them may have been derived from early MSS„ but the
probabilityis infinitely remote thet they are Catullian.
For the purposes of the present edition, their retention ¹
would he worse than useless. - The use os j and v for

the consonantal i and w may be pardoned on the scone
of convenience.
