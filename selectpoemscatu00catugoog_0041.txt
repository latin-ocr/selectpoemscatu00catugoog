xxxvi QUAESTIO II.

“could not have been puhlished in the author’s life
time” (Munro). Yet Munro affirma that Catullus
imitated Lucretius. Before this' view ean be accepted
we must believe that in the course of a few months,
and during the illness which proved fatal to Catullus
(unless he died a violent death, for which there is no
evidence), he studied Lucretius' great philosophical
work throughout-for the parallelisms are found in
every book of that work—and then wrote his longest
and most elaborated pceml, the ‘Peleus and Therae
if not also xxxrv. and (this would be incredible)nx1.
Munro admits that the philosopher Cicero himself
could not have read the “‘ De Natura '' four months
after the death of Lucretius,’ if he had not ‘had
anything to do with prepering it for publication!
Catullus, too, shows no taste for philosophy, no liking
for themora archaio Roman poetry. Still hrrther,
there is no reason to think that he wrote his idyll last
os all his writings3 it was quite as probably one ol his
earliest creations. Munro himself admits that ‘many
of Catullus’ occasional poems on the other hand had
in ull likelihood been seen by Lucretius! Most pro
bably, then, Catullus never read Lucretius3 who, it
must also be remarked, if ho imitated Catullus stall,
would be most likely to confine himself chiefly to the

hexameter poem The parallelisms are given below:-

²0r, at least, the ‘Anadne’ episode, which could not have
been at all suggested by Lumetius, and (see nm. introduc·
tion) is not as much out ol place as is generally supposed.
