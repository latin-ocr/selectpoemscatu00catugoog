and aska lor some light modern literature or love-poema of
Catullus’ own to soothe his loneliness. Catullus replies that
he cannot send love-poema ol his own, because his taatc ior
these has been checked and changed by his brother's recent
death. So, too, Manlius’ hint, that Verona is not a becoming
place ior a man ol pleasure and ol ton, is sadly answered Nor

V. 12, by laic, v. 28, answering Catullus' own word buc, v. 36,
and by altro deferrem ; lor how was Catullus likely to hare
taken books and poema to Manlius anasked, unless he had
