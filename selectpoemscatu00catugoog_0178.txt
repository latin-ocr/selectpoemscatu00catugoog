In this Ep llion Catullus has made extensive use ot his
wide knowle ff of Greek literature: on the subject olbis

debts to the reeh poete, see Quaestio 1. He hae also been

largely imitated by later Latin writers: see Quaestio H. For

an account of the Catullian Hexameter, see Appendix I. G.
This poem has been much criticised for the ‘inordinate dis·

proportron of its parta} and ‘want ol artistic finish at the ·

are made, however, by the same scholars who marntarn, alli
olio modo, the rigid mathematicale etry of Catullus' other

ms. These scholare will there ore be ready to admit that
atullus could not have committed these lenlte nnconseiouely.
He mnsthave intended the alleged ‘disproportion ol the parte,'
he must have meant to be careleeeo ‘artistic finish atne
junctum! In fairness, then, we should examine his purpose
before condenming the meane he took to work it out, and il

The simple argument ol the poem has been told in the General
Introduct1on1. p. ix. The purpose of the poem is equally
tremeret-arturetransmeare?
but suffering followed close as the medicine <if sin, and
wronged innocence was exalted. An earthly hero was wel-
corneto the gods, who honoured him with affinityto them-
selves, with grite, and with their presence at his table. For
men were then of pure, good birth; and from the union of
god and man sprung the brightest patterne of chivalry.

The general sentiment is similer to that of the Fonrth
Eelogue of virgil. In onepertieular, the blessednese of family

nrity-a feeliplp much stron er and more predominant in
icone et the f of the Repu licthnn we can well under-
stand now-appears in Catullus’ address to the heroes (ur-24) '
